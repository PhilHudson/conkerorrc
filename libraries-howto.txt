You're correct that 'require' does not work for this purpose.  The reason
is that ~/.conkerorrc is not considered a repository of modules - just a
bucket of *.js files that are loaded at startup.  If you have need of
modules, make a directory for your modules, add its location to
'load_paths', and 'require' away.

    let (home = get_home_directory().clone()) {
        home.appendRelativePath(".conkerorrc/modules");
        load_paths.unshift("file://"+home.path);
    }
